# Code

As a research group working on system softawre, we have a great deal of
interest in publishing open source software, both as a research output and for
making everybody's research more efficient. We will be adding more in future.

## Research

  * [MassiveThreads](https://github.com/massivethreads/massivethreads) is a high performance multithreading library supporting millions of threads with Pthreads-compatible API. 
  * [GXP](https://github.com/qnu/gxp/) is a parallel shell for clusters, supercomputers, and distributed systems, also supporting parallel/distributed make. 
  * [sshfsmux](https://github.com/qnu/sshfsmux/) is a FUSE-based file system that allows a node to mount multiple hosts via ssh on the same mount point. 
  * [paratrac](https://github.com/qnu/paratrac/) is a FUSE-based file system profiling tool 

## Small Tools

  * [textshot](https://github.com/taura/textshot) is a simple wrapper around jumpshot-4 (slog2) performance visualizer, supporting super simple text-based log format. 
  * [cpulock](https://github.com/taura/cpulock) is a utility to run multiple processes (multithreaded or not), assigning a set of CPUs exclusively to each process. 
  * [smart-gnuplotter](https://github.com/taura/smart_gnuplotter) is a python library to draw tons of gnuplot graphs easily; useful to automate producing tex papers/slides containing lots of graphs. 
  * [MassiveLogger](https://github.com/massivethreads/massivelogger) is a lightweight logging library for multi-threading written in C; it comes with a dedicated viewer written in [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html). 

## Others

  * [mdoch](https://github.com/qnu/mdoch/) is a work-in-progress to writing molecular dynamics simulations in Chapel programming language, which also helps evaluate Chapel itself.
